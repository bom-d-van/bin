The separation of file looking up and changes monitoring brings an excellent and wonderful experiences (with a nuance level of irritation of course, it's man-made software).

How to use it with Go programs? If you don't mind re-installing and restarting program when you are making projects to your program, just do:

```
# with ls
ls '*.go' | entr -dr go run main.go

# with find
find . -iname '*.go' | entr -dr go run main.go
```

If you don't want to restart your program when there are compilation errors, you need some shell powers.

```
function grm {
	echo '----------------------------'
	echo 'go install'
	go install

	app=$(basename $(pwd))

	if pgrep $app > /dev/null; then
		echo kill $app
		pkill $app
	fi

	echo "running $app"
	$GOPATH/bin/$app
}

find . -iname '*.go' | entr -dr grm
```

Note: the script above makes tons of asumptions.
